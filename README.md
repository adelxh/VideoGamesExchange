# Video Games Favourites - Web App to Add Your Favourite Games 
## Project Overview
Developed and designed a small web app allowing users to add their favourite video games and later go on and see a list of their video games added. 

## Project Requirements 
### 1. Login Authorization
   * Not required for now
### 2. Video Games Submissions
   * User should be allowed to add video game details such as:
       * Name
       * Game Description
       * Condition
       * Genre
### 3. Storage 
  * Game details should be then saved to local storage
### 4. Saved Games 
  * Games that were added should be visible on the Saved page of the web app
  * Should also have a search field where a user can search games based on the name
### 5. Error handling 
  * User should NOT be able to upload a video game without entering ALL of the details about a specific video game

## Time Estimate 
0.5 days 

## Design Principles
* Design principles for this project were simple:
   * make it look clean
   * use neutral colors
   * accessible font-sizes
   * responsive design for all screen sizes such as: tablet, phone, large desktops 

## Future Features 
* In the future, I plan to implement login authorization to enable personalized access, allowing each signed-in user to view games saved specifically to their profile.
